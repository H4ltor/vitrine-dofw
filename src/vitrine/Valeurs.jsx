                            industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since
                            the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
                            make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
                            the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                            popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
                            Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</footer>
